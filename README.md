# Flight Price Prediction

This short project on predicting the flight prices uses a dataset which does not carry much information and the fields in the data are less strongly correlated to the output variable. But yet I have tried to model the algorithm in the best way possible which would give a minimal value of cost function.

I have used several regression models to predict the prices, such as:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression
- Descision Tree Regressor
